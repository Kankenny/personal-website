		description: `As a fan of Risk of Rain 2, I'm always excited to jump into the action as a survivor battling my way through hordes of enemies on a distant alien planet. This fast-paced, rogue-like shooter not only tests my skills, but also my strategy as I navigate through randomly generated levels, gather power-ups and equipment, and face off against massive bosses. The ultimate goal is to survive long enough to escape the planet, but the real challenge is in figuring out the best ways to overcome the obstacles and enemies that stand in my way. Whether I'm working alone or teaming up with friends, Risk of Rain 2 never fails to deliver a pulse-pounding experience filled with excitement and adventure.`,

The items I collect throughout each run can greatly impact my survivor's abilities and stats, making every run unique and challenging. The satisfaction of discovering new item combinations and strategies is what keeps me coming back for more. The thrill of taking on tougher and tougher enemies with increasing power is truly exhilarating.`,
