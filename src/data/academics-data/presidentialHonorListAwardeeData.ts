			'As a computer science major at NYIT Manhattan, I am proud to say that my hard work and dedication paid off. During my senior year, I maintained a CGPA of 3.94/4.00 while balancing various projects and having a part-time job. This level of academic excellence did not go unnoticed and I was consistently awarded the Presidential List Scholar Award. Receiving this award allowed me to maintain my scholarship from my freshman year until my senior year, a testament to my consistent dedication and commitment to my studies. I am honored to have received this recognition and grateful for the opportunities it has provided me.',
