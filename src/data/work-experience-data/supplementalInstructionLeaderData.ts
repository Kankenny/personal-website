			'As a Supplemental Instruction Leader at NYIT Manhattan Campus, I guide students in mastering integral calculus by teaching them various integration techniques such as substitution, integration by parts, partial fraction decomposition and more. In addition, I highlight the practical applications of integrals, including finding the area under and between curves, calculating volume, and solving problems in physics and engineering. My aim is to bring clarity to this often challenging subject, enabling students to not just memorize formulas, but truly understand and appreciate the power of integrals.',
